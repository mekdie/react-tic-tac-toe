# Tic-Tac-Toe Game built with React

This project was based on Official React Tutorial by [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Version Changelog

\*Note: bold texts are the customized version of my implementation differing from the original tutorial.

### Version 0.1:

-   First release with basic game functionality
-   **Custom styling on the game board**
-   **Changed the file structure into separate components and folder/files(not in one JS file)**
-   **Rewritten the tutorial from class based components into functional based component**

### Version 0.2:

-   Lifting the state up to the main component (App.js) to show the past moves
-   **_Bug found: the board is moving around when the next player indicator changes_**
